abstract = {Creating a Mashup, a web application that integrates data from multiple web sources to provide a unique service, involves solving multiple problems, such as extracting data from multiple web sources, cleaning it, and combining it together. Existing work relies on a widget paradigm where users address those problems during a Mashup building process by selecting, customizing, and connecting widgets together. While these systems claim that their users do not have to write a single line of code, merely abstracting programming methods into widgets has several disadvantages. First, as the number of widgets increases to support more operations, locating the right widget for the task can be confusing and time consuming. Second, customizing and connecting these widgets usually requires users to understand programming concepts. In this paper, we present a Mashup building approach that (a) combines most problem areas in Mashup building into a unified interactive framework that requires no widgets, and (b) allows users with no programming background to easily create Mashups by example.},

Bounded rationality, bounded communication, subjectivity and distribution make it extremely challenging to find effective strategies. In these domains it is difficult to accurately predict whether potential policy modifications will lead to an increase in the value of the team re- ward. Our Predictability and Criticality Metrics (PCM) approach errs on the side of safety, and advocates considering policy modifi- cations that are guaranteed to not harm the current policy, and uses simple metrics to choose from within that set a modification that increases the team reward. In the context of the DARPA Coordi- nators program, we show how the PCM approach yielded a system that significantly outperformed several competing approaches in an extensive independent evaluation.},

Past work in the area of databases has resulted in different query interface systems that simplify query formulation. While these approaches reduce the user's effort to compose queries, the user is still required to pick data sources to use and the interaction is not guaranteed to yield a non-empty result set. We introduce a novel approach that exploits the structure of the relational data source(s) to formulate a set of constraints. These constraints are used in conjunction with partial plans to produce an intelligent query interface that (a) does not require the user to know details about data sources or existing values (b) suggests valid inputs to the user (c) creates consistent queries that always return values.

abstract = {Ontologies define hierarchies of classes and attributes; they are meta-data: data about data. In the "traditional approach" to on- tology engineering, experts add new data by carefully analyzing others' ontologies and fitting their new concepts into the existing hierarchy. In the emerging "Semantic Web approach", ordinary users may not look at anyone's ontology before creating theirs - instead, they may simply define a new local schema from scratch that addresses their immediate needs, without worrying if and how their data may some day integrate with others' data. This paper describes WebScripter, a tool for trans- lating between the countless mini-ontologies that the "Semantic Web approach" yields. In our approach, ordinary users graphically align data from multiple sources in a simple spreadsheet-like view without having to know anything about ontologies. The resulting web of equivalency state- ments is then mined by WebScripter to help users find related ontologies and data, and to automatically align the related data with their own.},

	Abstract = {Recent structured peer-to-peer (P2P) systems such as distributed hash tables (DHTs) offer scalable key-based lookup for distributed resources. However, they cannot be simply applied to grid information services because grid resources need to be registered and searched using multiple attributes. We propose a multiattribute addressable network (MAAN) which extends chord to support multiattribute and range queries. MAAN addresses range queries by mapping attribute values to the chord identifier space via uniform locality preserving hashing. It uses an iterative or single attribute dominated query routing algorithm to resolve multiattribute based queries. Each node in MAAN only has O(logN) neighbors for N nodes. The number of routing hops to resolve a multiattribute range query is O(logN+N times;smin), where smin is the minimum range selectivity on all attributes. When smin= #949;, it is logarithmic to the number of nodes, which is scalable to a large number of nodes and attributes. We also measured the performance of our MAAN implementation and the experimental results are consistent with our theoretical analysis.},

It exploits the users' familiarity with these and is well suited for the input of simple attribute-value data (name, phone number, ...). The paper-forms paradigm starts breaking down when there is user input that may or may not be applicable depending on previous user input. In paper-based forms, this manifests itself by sections marked "fill out only if you entered yes in question 8a above", and simple electronic forms suffer from the same problem -- much space is taken up for input fields that are not applicable. One possible approach to making only relevant sections appear is to hand-write program fragments to hide and show them. As an alternative, we have developed a form specification language based on a context-free grammar that encodes data dependencies of the input, together with an accompanying run-time interpreter that uses novel layout techniques for collapsing already-entered input fields, for "blending" input fields possibly yet to come, and for showing only the applicable sections of the form.},

abstract = {Currently, building a user interface involves creating a large procedural program. Model- based programming provides an alternative new paradigm. In the model-based paradigm, developers create a declarative model that describes the tasks that users are expected to accomplish with a system, the functional capabilities of a system, the style and requirements of the interface, the characteristics and preferences of the users, and the I/O techniques supported by the delivery platform. Based on the model, a much smaller procedural program then determines the behavior of the system. There are several advantages to this approach. The declarative model is a common representation that tools can reason about, enabling the construction of tools that automate various aspects of interface design, that assist system builders in the creation of the model, that automatically provide context sensitive help and other run-time assistance to users. The common model also allows the tools that operate on it to cooperate. Because all components of the system share the knowledge in the model, this promotes interface consistency within and across systems and reusability in the construction of new interfaces. The declarative nature of the model allows system builders to more easily understand and extend systems. This paper describes the modeling language of MASTERMIND, a model-based user interface development environment.},

However, conventional constraints directly encode the objects they reference, and thus cannot provide support for the dynamic runtime creation and manipulation of application objects. This paper discusses an extension to current constraint models that allows constraints to indirectly reference objects through pointer variables. Pointer variables permit programmers to create the constraint equivalent of procedures in traditional programming languages. This procedural abstraction allows constraints to model a wide array of dynamic application behavior, simplifies the implementation of structured object and demonstrational systems, and improves the storage and efficiency of highly interactive, graphical applications. It also promotes a simpler, more effective style of programming than conventional constraints. Constraints that use pointer variables are powerful enough to allow a comprehensive user interface toolkit to be built for the first time on top of a constraint system.},

abstract = {The user interface building blocks of any User Interface Management System (UIMS) have built-in assumptions about what information about application programs they need, and assumptions about how to get that information. The lack of a standard to represent this information leads to a proliferation of different assumptions by different building blocks, hampering changeability of the user interface and portability of applications to different sets of building blocks. This paper describes a formalism for specifying the information about applications needed by the user interface building blocks (i.e. the UIMS/Application interface) so that all building blocks share a common set of assumptions. The paper also describes a set of user interface building blocks specifically designed for these standard UIMS/Application interfaces. These building blocks can be used to produce a wide variety of user interfaces, and the interfaces can be changed without having to change the application program.},
