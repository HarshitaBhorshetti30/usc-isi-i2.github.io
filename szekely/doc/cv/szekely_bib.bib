abstract = {Creating a Mashup, a web application that integrates data from multiple web sources to provide a unique service, involves solving multiple problems, such as extracting data from multiple web sources, cleaning it, and combining it together. Existing work relies on a widget paradigm where users address those problems during a Mashup building process by selecting, customizing, and connecting widgets together. While these systems claim that their users do not have to write a single line of code, merely abstracting programming methods into widgets has several disadvantages. First, as the number of widgets increases to support more operations, locating the right widget for the task can be confusing and time consuming. Second, customizing and connecting these widgets usually requires users to understand programming concepts. In this paper, we present a Mashup building approach that (a) combines most problem areas in Mashup building into a unified interactive framework that requires no widgets, and (b) allows users with no programming background to easily create Mashups by example.},

Bounded rationality, bounded communication, subjectivity and distribution make it extremely challenging to find effective strategies. In these domains it is difficult to accurately predict whether potential policy modifications will lead to an increase in the value of the team re- ward. Our Predictability and Criticality Metrics (PCM) approach errs on the side of safety, and advocates considering policy modifi- cations that are guaranteed to not harm the current policy, and uses simple metrics to choose from within that set a modification that increases the team reward. In the context of the DARPA Coordi- nators program, we show how the PCM approach yielded a system that significantly outperformed several competing approaches in an extensive independent evaluation.},

Past work in the area of databases has resulted in different query interface systems that simplify query formulation. While these approaches reduce the user's effort to compose queries, the user is still required to pick data sources to use and the interaction is not guaranteed to yield a non-empty result set. We introduce a novel approach that exploits the structure of the relational data source(s) to formulate a set of constraints. These constraints are used in conjunction with partial plans to produce an intelligent query interface that (a) does not require the user to know details about data sources or existing values (b) suggests valid inputs to the user (c) creates consistent queries that always return values.

abstract = {Ontologies define hierarchies of classes and attributes; they are meta-data: data about data. In the "traditional approach" to on- tology engineering, experts add new data by carefully analyzing others' ontologies and fitting their new concepts into the existing hierarchy. In the emerging "Semantic Web approach", ordinary users may not look at anyone's ontology before creating theirs - instead, they may simply define a new local schema from scratch that addresses their immediate needs, without worrying if and how their data may some day integrate with others' data. This paper describes WebScripter, a tool for trans- lating between the countless mini-ontologies that the "Semantic Web approach" yields. In our approach, ordinary users graphically align data from multiple sources in a simple spreadsheet-like view without having to know anything about ontologies. The resulting web of equivalency state- ments is then mined by WebScripter to help users find related ontologies and data, and to automatically align the related data with their own.},

	Abstract = {Recent structured peer-to-peer (P2P) systems such as distributed hash tables (DHTs) offer scalable key-based lookup for distributed resources. However, they cannot be simply applied to grid information services because grid resources need to be registered and searched using multiple attributes. We propose a multiattribute addressable network (MAAN) which extends chord to support multiattribute and range queries. MAAN addresses range queries by mapping attribute values to the chord identifier space via uniform locality preserving hashing. It uses an iterative or single attribute dominated query routing algorithm to resolve multiattribute based queries. Each node in MAAN only has O(logN) neighbors for N nodes. The number of routing hops to resolve a multiattribute range query is O(logN+N times;smin), where smin is the minimum range selectivity on all attributes. When smin= #949;, it is logarithmic to the number of nodes, which is scalable to a large number of nodes and attributes. We also measured the performance of our MAAN implementation and the experimental results are consistent with our theoretical analysis.},

It exploits the users' familiarity with these and is well suited for the input of simple attribute-value data (name, phone number, ...). The paper-forms paradigm starts breaking down when there is user input that may or may not be applicable depending on previous user input. In paper-based forms, this manifests itself by sections marked "fill out only if you entered yes in question 8a above", and simple electronic forms suffer from the same problem -- much space is taken up for input fields that are not applicable. One possible approach to making only relevant sections appear is to hand-write program fragments to hide and show them. As an alternative, we have developed a form specification language based on a context-free grammar that encodes data dependencies of the input, together with an accompanying run-time interpreter that uses novel layout techniques for collapsing already-entered input fields, for "blending" input fields possibly yet to come, and for showing only the applicable sections of the form.},

abstract = {Currently, building a user interface involves creating a large procedural program. Model- based programming provides an alternative new paradigm. In the model-based paradigm, developers create a declarative model that describes the tasks that users are expected to accomplish with a system, the functional capabilities of a system, the style and requirements of the interface, the characteristics and preferences of the users, and the I/O techniques supported by the delivery platform. Based on the model, a much smaller procedural program then determines the behavior of the system. There are several advantages to this approach. The declarative model is a common representation that tools can reason about, enabling the construction of tools that automate various aspects of interface design, that assist system builders in the creation of the model, that automatically provide context sensitive help and other run-time assistance to users. The common model also allows the tools that operate on it to cooperate. Because all components of the system share the knowledge in the model, this promotes interface consistency within and across systems and reusability in the construction of new interfaces. The declarative nature of the model allows system builders to more easily understand and extend systems. This paper describes the modeling language of MASTERMIND, a model-based user interface development environment.},

However, conventional constraints directly encode the objects they reference, and thus cannot provide support for the dynamic runtime creation and manipulation of application objects. This paper discusses an extension to current constraint models that allows constraints to indirectly reference objects through pointer variables. Pointer variables permit programmers to create the constraint equivalent of procedures in traditional programming languages. This procedural abstraction allows constraints to model a wide array of dynamic application behavior, simplifies the implementation of structured object and demonstrational systems, and improves the storage and efficiency of highly interactive, graphical applications. It also promotes a simpler, more effective style of programming than conventional constraints. Constraints that use pointer variables are powerful enough to allow a comprehensive user interface toolkit to be built for the first time on top of a constraint system.},

abstract = {The user interface building blocks of any User Interface Management System (UIMS) have built-in assumptions about what information about application programs they need, and assumptions about how to get that information. The lack of a standard to represent this information leads to a proliferation of different assumptions by different building blocks, hampering changeability of the user interface and portability of applications to different sets of building blocks. This paper describes a formalism for specifying the information about applications needed by the user interface building blocks (i.e. the UIMS/Application interface) so that all building blocks share a common set of assumptions. The paper also describes a set of user interface building blocks specifically designed for these standard UIMS/Application interfaces. These building blocks can be used to produce a wide variety of user interfaces, and the interfaces can be changed without having to change the application program.},

Coral (Constraint-based Object-oriented Relations And Language) is a new user interface toolkit under development that uses efficiently-implemented constraints to support these relationships. Using Coral, user interface designers can construct interaction techniques such as menus and scroll bars. More importantly, Coral makes it easy to construct direct-manipulation user interfaces specialized to particular applications. Unlike previous constraint-based toolkits, Coral supports defining constraints in the abstract, and then applying them to different object instances. In addition, it provides iteration constructs where lists of items (such as those used in menus) can be constrained as a group. Coral has two interfaces: a declarative interface that provides a convenient way to specify the desired constraints, and a procedural interface that will allow a graphical user interface management system (UIMS) to automatically create Coral calls.},

However, they cannot be simply applied to grid information services because grid resources need to be registered and searched using multiple attributes. We propose a multiattribute addressable network (MAAN) which extends chord to support multiattribute and range queries. MAAN addresses range queries by mapping attribute values to the chord identifier space via uniform locality preserving hashing. It uses an iterative or single attribute dominated query routing algorithm to resolve multiattribute based queries. Each node in MAAN only has O(logN) neighbors for N nodes. The number of routing hops to resolve a multiattribute range query is O(logN+N times;smin), where smin is the minimum range selectivity on all attributes. When smin= {\#}949;, it is logarithmic to the number of nodes, which is scalable to a large number of nodes and attributes. We also measured the performance of our MAAN implementation and the experimental results are consistent with our theoretical analysis.},

These lessons reveal the design and implementation tradeoffs for dif- ferent one-way, constraint satisfaction algorithms. The most important lessons we have learned are that (1) mark-sweep algorithms are more efficient than topological ordering algorithms; (2) lazy and eager evaluators deliver roughly comparable performance for most applications; and (3) con- straint satisfaction algorithms have more than adequate speed, except that the storage required by these algorithms can be problematic.},

abstract = {Pointer variables have long been considered useful for constructing and manipulating data structures in traditional programming languages. This article discusses how pointer variables can be integrated into one-way constraint models and indicates how these constraints can be usefully employed in user interfaces. Pointer variables allow constraints to model a wide array of dynamic application behavior, simplify the implementation of structured objects and demonstrational systems, and improve the storage and efficiency of constraint-based applications. This article presents two incremental algorithms --- one lazy and one eager --- for solving constraints with pointer variables. Both algorithms are capable of handling (1) arbitrary systems of one-way constraints, including constraints that involve cycles, and (2) editing models that allow multiple changes between calls to the constraint solver. These algorithms are fault tolerant in that they can handle and recover gracefully from formulas that crash due to programmer error. Constraints that use pointer variables have been implemented in a comprehensive user interface toolkit, Garnet, and our experience with applications written in Garnet have proven the usefulness of pointer variable constraints. Many large-scale applications have been implemented using these constraints.},

The COUSIN project of Carnegie-Mellon University is developing command interfaces which appear more friendly and supportive to their users, using a form-based model of communication, and incorporating error correction and on-line help. Because of the time and effort involved in constructing truly user-friendly interfaces, we are working on interface system designed to provide interfaces to many different application systems, as opposed to separate interfaces to individual applications. A COUSIN interface system gets the information it needs to provide these services for a given application from a declarative description of that application's communication needs.},

abstract = {We investigate the problem of keeping the plans of mul- tiple agents synchronized during execution. We assume that agents only have a partial view of the overall plan. They know the tasks they must perform, and know the tasks of other agents with whom they have direct depen- dencies. Initially, agents are given a schedule of tasks to perform together with a collection of contingency plans that they can engage during execution in case execu- tion deviates from the plan. During execution, agents monitor the status of their tasks, adjusting their local schedules as necessary and informing dependent agents about the changes. When agents determine that their schedule is broken or that a contingency schedule may be better, they engage in coordinating plan changes with other agents. We present a "dynamic partial central- ization" approach to coordination. When a unit detects a problem (task delay, inability to perform a task), it will dynamically form a cluster of the critically affected agents (a subset of all potentially affected agents). The cluster will elect a leader, who will retrieve all task and contingency plan information from the cluster members and compute a solution depending on the situation.},

In the "traditional approach" to ontology engineering, experts add new data by carefully analyzing others' ontologies and fitting their new concepts into the existing hierarchy. In the emerging "Semantic Web approach", ordinary users may not look at anyone's ontology before creating theirs - instead, they may simply define a new local schema from scratch that addresses their immediate needs, without worrying if and how their data may some day integrate with others' data. This paper describes WebScripter, a tool for translating between the countless mini-ontologies that the "Semantic Web approach" yields. In our approach, ordinary users graphically align data from multiple sources in a simple spreadsheet-like view without having to know anything about ontologies. The resulting web of equivalency statements is then mined by WebScripter to help users find related ontologies and data, and to automatically align the related data with their own.},

High-level UIMSs and automated designers support more sophisticated displays but are not easy to use as they require dealing explicitly with elaborate abstract concepts. This paper describes a GUI development environment, HandsOn, where complex displays of dynamically changing data can be constructed by direct manipulation. HandsOn integrates principles of graphic design, supports constraint-based layout, and has facilities for easily specifying the layout of collections of data. The system incorporates Programming By Example techniques to relieve the designer from having to deal with abstractions, and relies on a model-based language for the representation of the displays being constructed and as a means to provide information for the tool to reason about.},

The system gives users control over the automation by providing an expressive language and a convenient, easy- to-use user interface to specify the policies. The interesting and challenging aspect of the problem arises from the context in which the system operates. The end users are contract managers and buyers who are not trained in computers or programming. They enter their new supply contracts and define policy rules to control selection of the best contracts for buying requested parts. They act as their own knowledge engineers, even though the system is expected to have hundreds of rules for hundreds of contracts. The users interact with the system infrequently, perhaps only a few times a month when they begin or modify contracts, or change policies. Along with a moderate turnover rate of users, this makes it crucial that they can easily maintain correct rules with minimal training. In this paper, we describe a rule system and an interactive rule authoring tool designed to address the problems raised by this context. We believe these issues arise in most application domains where rule systems are put in the hands of the end users.},

(For a more detailed discussion of these issues, see Neches, 92.) These include: limited understanding of the agent's capabilities, limited understanding of the language available to instruct the agent, limited ability to think and communicate in terms of algorithms, limited ability to analyze interactions between high-level requests. Our approach attempts to offer a sensible alternative. It is built upon two key ideas: (1) the Business Rule Manager, a set of mechanisms for providing constrained dialogues between user and system; and, (2) and a tiered interaction framework, a system that supports social evolution of communications by helping a community of users help each other develop a common language for talking with their agents. We present our approach to this problem in the context of DEALMAKER, an agent for selecting the best source of supply to fill orders. It receives requisitions for items in electronic form, queries a database of preferred vendors to determine possible sources of supply, and applies rules to filter and rank these sources according to policies established by contract managers.},

abstract = {One of the strongest limitations of knowledge-acquisition metatools---tools that automate the development of knowledge-acquisition tools---is that the interface-design knowledge employed by such metatools to produce domain-specific knowledge-acquisition tools is not explicit and cannot be used by other metatools. Therefore, the usefulness of a metatool is restricted to its own implementation environment. A possible solution to this problem is the definition of a shareable ontology of knowledge-acquisition tools that represents explicitly the relevant knowledge of tool design and development. We take the position that the design of knowledge-acquisition tools is similar to the design of user interfaces, and that an ontology of knowledge-acquisition tools is a special case of an interface ontology. We propose that a shareable interface ontology can be defined by analyzing interface ontologies used in model-based user-interface development systems, and by resolving differences and conflicts among the ontologies---a process called model alignment. We present the initial results of a model alignment for the interface ontologies of two user-interface development systems: SHELTER and Mecano. We also show how the resulting shareable interface ontology underpins a framework in which each system can be applied to different parts of the process of generating a single, domain-specific knowledge-acquisition tool, thus creating a generation of metatools useful across multiple implementation environments.},

abstract = {We describe MASTERMIND, a step toward our vision of a knowledge-based design-time and run-time environment in which human-computer interfaces development is centered around an all-encompassing design model. The MASTERMIND approach is intended to provide integration and continuity across the entire life cycle of the user interface. In addition, it facilitates higher quality work within each phase of the life cycle. MASTERMIND is an open framework, in which the design knowledge base allows multiple tools to come into play and makes knowledge created by each tool accessible to the others.},
