abstract = {We investigate the problem of keeping the plans of mul- tiple agents synchronized during execution. We assume that agents only have a partial view of the overall plan. They know the tasks they must perform, and know the tasks of other agents with whom they have direct depen- dencies. Initially, agents are given a schedule of tasks to perform together with a collection of contingency plans that they can engage during execution in case execu- tion deviates from the plan. During execution, agents monitor the status of their tasks, adjusting their local schedules as necessary and informing dependent agents about the changes. When agents determine that their schedule is broken or that a contingency schedule may be better, they engage in coordinating plan changes with other agents. We present a "dynamic partial central- ization" approach to coordination. When a unit detects a problem (task delay, inability to perform a task), it will dynamically form a cluster of the critically affected agents (a subset of all potentially affected agents). The cluster will elect a leader, who will retrieve all task and contingency plan information from the cluster members and compute a solution depending on the situation.},

abstract = {Ontologies define hierarchies of classes and attributes; they are meta-data: data about data. In the "traditional approach" to ontology engineering, experts add new data by carefully analyzing others' ontologies and fitting their new concepts into the existing hierarchy. In the emerging "Semantic Web approach", ordinary users may not look at anyone's ontology before creating theirs - instead, they may simply define a new local schema from scratch that addresses their immediate needs, without worrying if and how their data may some day integrate with others' data. This paper describes WebScripter, a tool for translating between the countless mini-ontologies that the "Semantic Web approach" yields. In our approach, ordinary users graphically align data from multiple sources in a simple spreadsheet-like view without having to know anything about ontologies. The resulting web of equivalency statements is then mined by WebScripter to help users find related ontologies and data, and to automatically align the related data with their own.},

High-level UIMSs and automated designers support more sophisticated displays but are not easy to use as they require dealing explicitly with elaborate abstract concepts. This paper describes a GUI development environment, HandsOn, where complex displays of dynamically changing data can be constructed by direct manipulation. HandsOn integrates principles of graphic design, supports constraint-based layout, and has facilities for easily specifying the layout of collections of data. The system incorporates Programming By Example techniques to relieve the designer from having to deal with abstractions, and relies on a model-based language for the representation of the displays being constructed and as a means to provide information for the tool to reason about.},

The system gives users control over the automation by providing an expressive language and a convenient, easy- to-use user interface to specify the policies. The interesting and challenging aspect of the problem arises from the context in which the system operates. The end users are contract managers and buyers who are not trained in computers or programming. They enter their new supply contracts and define policy rules to control selection of the best contracts for buying requested parts. They act as their own knowledge engineers, even though the system is expected to have hundreds of rules for hundreds of contracts. The users interact with the system infrequently, perhaps only a few times a month when they begin or modify contracts, or change policies. Along with a moderate turnover rate of users, this makes it crucial that they can easily maintain correct rules with minimal training. In this paper, we describe a rule system and an interactive rule authoring tool designed to address the problems raised by this context. We believe these issues arise in most application domains where rule systems are put in the hands of the end users.},

(For a more detailed discussion of these issues, see Neches, 92.) These include: limited understanding of the agent's capabilities, limited understanding of the language available to instruct the agent, limited ability to think and communicate in terms of algorithms, limited ability to analyze interactions between high-level requests. Our approach attempts to offer a sensible alternative. It is built upon two key ideas: (1) the Business Rule Manager, a set of mechanisms for providing constrained dialogues between user and system; and, (2) and a tiered interaction framework, a system that supports social evolution of communications by helping a community of users help each other develop a common language for talking with their agents. We present our approach to this problem in the context of DEALMAKER, an agent for selecting the best source of supply to fill orders. It receives requisitions for items in electronic form, queries a database of preferred vendors to determine possible sources of supply, and applies rules to filter and rank these sources according to policies established by contract managers.},

abstract = {One of the strongest limitations of knowledge-acquisition metatools---tools that automate the development of knowledge-acquisition tools---is that the interface-design knowledge employed by such metatools to produce domain-specific knowledge-acquisition tools is not explicit and cannot be used by other metatools. Therefore, the usefulness of a metatool is restricted to its own implementation environment. A possible solution to this problem is the definition of a shareable ontology of knowledge-acquisition tools that represents explicitly the relevant knowledge of tool design and development. We take the position that the design of knowledge-acquisition tools is similar to the design of user interfaces, and that an ontology of knowledge-acquisition tools is a special case of an interface ontology. We propose that a shareable interface ontology can be defined by analyzing interface ontologies used in model-based user-interface development systems, and by resolving differences and conflicts among the ontologies---a process called model alignment. We present the initial results of a model alignment for the interface ontologies of two user-interface development systems: SHELTER and Mecano. We also show how the resulting shareable interface ontology underpins a framework in which each system can be applied to different parts of the process of generating a single, domain-specific knowledge-acquisition tool, thus creating a generation of metatools useful across multiple implementation environments.},

abstract = {We describe MASTERMIND, a step toward our vision of a knowledge-based design-time and run-time environment in which human-computer interfaces development is centered around an all-encompassing design model. The MASTERMIND approach is intended to provide integration and continuity across the entire life cycle of the user interface. In addition, it facilitates higher quality work within each phase of the life cycle. MASTERMIND is an open framework, in which the design knowledge base allows multiple tools to come into play and makes knowledge created by each tool accessible to the others.},
