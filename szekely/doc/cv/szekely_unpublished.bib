abstract = {The CAMERA project produced the SNAP (Schedules Negotiated by Agent-based Planners) flight scheduling software in experimental use by Harrier squadrons of Marine Air Group 13, stationed in Yuma, AZ; it was also fielded aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard, the USS Belleau Wood, the USS Pelleliu and the USS Essex that conducted operations in Iraq, Japan and Afghanistan. The CAMERA project also produced an open hybrid solver architecture that allows off-the-shelf solvers to be combined to solve a problem. Finally, it produced a family of market-inspired negotiation algorithms called MARBLES.},

abstract = {This paper describes Humanoid's approach for assisting designers in the construction of the presentation component of a user interface (discussions of Humanoid's support for other aspects of interface design appear in [Szekely92]). The approach represents a compromise between two main approaches used in other systems: power tools for designers, and automated designers.},
