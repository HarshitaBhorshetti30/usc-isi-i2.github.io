		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<div class="content">
 		<p>Semantic Web technologies and deep learning share the goal of creating intelligent artifacts that emulate human capacities such as reasoning, validating, and predicting. There are notable examples of contributions leveraging either deep neural architectures or distributed representations learned via deep neural networks in the broad area of Semantic Web technologies. Knowledge Graphs (KG) are one of the most well-known outcomes from the Semantic Web community, with wide use in web search, text classification, entity linking etc. KGs are large networks of real-world entities described in terms of their semantic types and their relationships to each other. </p>
<p>
A challenging but paramount task for problems ranging from entity classification to entity recommendation or entity linking is that of learning features representing entities in the knowledge graph (building “knowledge graph embeddings”) that can be fed into machine learning algorithms. The feature learning process ought to be able to effectively capture the relational structure of the graph (i.e. connectivity patterns) as well as the semantics of its properties and classes, either in an unsupervised way and/or in a supervised way to optimize a downstream prediction task. In the past years, Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have been used to learn features from knowledge graphs, resulting in enhancements of the state-of-the-art in entity relatedness measures, entity recommendation systems and entity classification. DL algorithms have equally been applied to classic problems in semantic applications, such as (semi-automated) ontology learning, ontology alignment, duplicate recognition, ontology prediction, relation extraction, and semantically grounded inference.

		<h2>Keynote Speaker</h2>
		<div class="content">
 		<p>
 		The workshop will host a keynote speech given by Pascal Hitzler entitled "Neural-Symbolic Integration and Its Relevance to Deep Learning and the Semantic Web".
		</p>
<p>
 		<strong>Abstract:</strong> Research on the integration and interplay of symbolic and subsymbolic (or connectionist - based on artificial neural networks) systems has a considerable history in both computer science and cognitive science. With the recent advances in deep learning, i.e., in subsymbolic approaches, questions how to interface these methods with symbolic data or systems resurface with renewed urgency, and since Semantic Web data is inherently symbolic, these questions are inherently important for our field. Relevant aspects concern the application of subsymbolic methods to semantic web research topics such as data mapping and integration, or knowledge graph generation (formerly known as ontology population). They also concern the investigation of methods to utilize semantic web data to improve or explain deep learning systems. And on a more fundamental level they touch on the deep question how (human) symbolic conceptualizations and (artificial) neural networks fit together. In this talk, we will revisit some of the old questions and results in the light of current developments, and will discuss possible research directions.
