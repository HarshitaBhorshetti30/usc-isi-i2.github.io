Central to this examination will be the study of over 500,000 private and public firms having a web-based presence in the business services and manufacturing industries. These firms will have heterogeneous organizational forms, organizational relationships, and changes in organizational features over a 15 to 20 year sample period. The organizational forms will range from small private single-industry firms with few employees to larger public and private firms with multiple product divisions and both a domestic and international footprint. The identifiable relationships that govern firm interactions will range from horizontal links for competing firms, vertical links among customers and suppliers, and other economic links such as asset complementarities. Our sample will also include organizational changes as firms merge, split up, go public, go private, enter for the first time, or shut down. We will also link this data to U.S. Patent and Trademark data to assess how patents affect the growth rates of both private and publicly traded firms in new and old industries and what products firms offer to consumers. Our goal is to create one of the most comprehensive databases of firms in the form of a dynamic network-based industry classification that can empower economic research on assessing the role of economic links and organizational forms on economic outcomes, and especially how they di er for smaller private firms, a sample which is omitted from most existing research due to data limitations.</td>

We will study these firms and the products they offer by first building a large-scale database that will contain information on products and services offered by firms that would be extracted from the web pages of both private firms and publicly traded firms. We will build this database using the Internet Archive Wayback Machine project (http://archive.org/web/web.php). Using the text from these web pages, we will classify firms as competitors and build new industry definitions. These new industry definitions will thus be based directly on the product and service words firms use to interface with customers. From a theoretical perspective, this level of interface is most relevant as this interface identifies how firms compete for customers, how they generate profits, and how various markets attract firms and consumers to engage and do business. This database would be a significant expansion of an existing database of 6,000 public firms to over 500,000 firms - both private and publicly traded. The existing database has approximately 6,000 publicly traded firms and is based on firm 10-Ks. We would additionally link these firms to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Once data using name and address resolution.</td>

We will build this analytical tool based on Elastic Search" (www.elasticsearch.com). This will allow users to query our database of public and private firms, identify their competitors, and the products they offer. ElasticSearch is a flexible open source search software that can be downloaded, used and modified, free of charge. It is available under the Apache 2 open source license. The list of competitors will also be accompanied by pairwise similarity scores, indicating the strength of competitive links, and we will also offer tools to allow the firms in a given firm's local product market to be visualized as a network.</td>

	      <td  class="main_page_text" align="justify">The economic foundation for this proposal is based on Hoberg and Phillips (2015b)<a href="http://hobergphillips.usc.edu/"></a>. This article develops a new text-based network industry classification system (henceforth TNIC) using the verbal content of business descriptions from 5,000 firms and 70,000 firm 10-K filings from 1996 to present. Hoberg and Phillips (2015b) establishes the TNIC classification and validates its explanatory power relative to existing classifications. The article rigorously establishes the advantages of a time varying intransitive network, and presents a single-industry study of the military industry and its evolution following the events of September 11, 2001. The paper further tests the theory
of endogenous barriers to entry by Sutton (1991). We find that investments in research and development and advertising are influential in reducing the degree of ex-post competition surrounding a firm, as predicted by Sutton's theory. This paper is currently forthcoming in the Journal of Political Economy.</td>
