Second, many such high quality maps are embedded in other documents such as PDF reports, PowerPoint presentations, etc. Therefore, we have to analyze these documents as well to obtain those high quality maps.</td>

Figure 4 shows how we find the most similar images using the CBIR technique. Given a new query image, the CBIR system matches it with all the images in the map and nonmap repository and then finds the most similar images.</td>
