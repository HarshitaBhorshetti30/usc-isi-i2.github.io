However, different sources often have different schemas, access methods, and coverage. To address this issue, we have developed a data integration framework called Prometheus that facilitates uniform access to the sources. Prometheus provides an infrastructure that can be used to (a) quickly build applications that integrate data from various data sources, and (b) can be used as a test bed for information integration researchers to build and test new information integration techniques. Our group has focused on the data integration systems for a long time. Before Prometheus, our group had designed SIMS and Ariadne mediators.</td>

While traditional view integration techniques apply directly to the problem of dynamic service composition, new challenges arise. We developed a new optimization technique called <a href="load.html?src=http://www.isi.edu/integration/papers/thakkar05-vldb.pdf">tuple-level filtering</a> that introducing sensing and filtering operations to optimize the template integration plans generated for web services.</li>

          <li class="main_page_text"><b>Incorporating operations to support geo-spatial datatypes </b>- In 
the <i><a href="../TerraWorld">TerraWorld</a></i> project, we are extending the mediator to support integration of a wide variety of geo-spatial data, such as, satellite imagery, maps, and vector data. The key new challenges in geospatial domain in accurately combine the retrieved information. For example, when integrating road vector data with a satellite imagery, we need to align the vector data with the satellite imagery, i.e. ensure that roads in the vector data line up with roads in the satellite imagery. In our <a href="load.html?src=http://www.isi.edu/integration/papers/chen04-acmgis.pdf">ACMGIS 2004 paper</a>, we described techniques to automatically align vector data with imagery. Currently, we are working on representing the alignment operations in the mediator, so that the mediator can dynamically generates plans to not just retrieve geospatial data, but also accurately integrate different types of geospatial data.</li>
