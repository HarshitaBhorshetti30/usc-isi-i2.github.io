These sources could be Web services with well-defined inputs and outputs or even Web forms that take a specific input and generate a result page as the output. The system is then tasked with finding additional sources that are similar, but not necessarily identical, to the known source. For example, the system may already know about several weather services and then be given the task of finding new ones that provide additional coverage for the world and building a semantic description of these new weather services that makes it possible to turn them into Semantic Web Services.</td>

Second, once we have found such a source, extract data from it. For a web service, this is not an issue, but for a Web site with a form-based interface, the source might simply return an HTML page from which the data has to be extracted. Third, given the syntactic structure of a source (i.e., the inputs and outputs), identify the semantics of the inputs and outputs of that source. Fourth, given the inputs and outputs, find the function that maps the inputs to the outputs. Given the semantic description, we can then construct a wrapper that turns the source into a Semantic Web Service that can be directly integrated into the Semantic Web.</td>

For example, given a weather service that returns current weather conditions at a specified location, the method can identify other weather services by exploiting the tags used to describe such sources on <a href="http://del.icio.us/" target="_blank">del.icio.us</a>. Tags are keywords from an uncontrolled personal vocabulary that users employ to organize bookmarked Web sources on <a href="http://del.icio.us/" target="_blank">del.icio.us</a>. We use topic modeling techniques, such as LDA, to identify sources whose tag distribution is similar to that of the given source.</td>

The page template is therefore shared by all pages returned by the source. Given two or more sample pages, we can derive the page template and use it to automatically extract data from the pages.</td>
