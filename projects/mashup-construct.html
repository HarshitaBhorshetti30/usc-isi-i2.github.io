				<td colspan="2" class="main_page_text" align="justify">Mashups provide an integrated and effective approach to extract, integrate and view diverse information. Some interesting examples of Mashups on Internet are <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.zillow.com/" target="_blank" style="font-weight:bold">Zillow</a> and <a rel="noopener" href="http://wikimapia.org" target="_blank" style="font-weight:bold">WikiMapia</a>. However, the process of creating a Mashup often requires programming knowledge and background information of widgets to use existing technologies such as <a rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Pipes" target="_blank" style="font-weight:bold">Yahoo Pipes</a> and <a rel="noopener" href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mash-maker-mashups-for-the-masses" target="_blank" style="font-weight:bold">Intel Mashmaker</a>. Therefore, we have developed a system called Karma where the user is able to create a Mashup in a one seamless interactive process using the programming by demonstration paradigm. It allows end-users to rapidly acquire the relevant data, get it into an appropriate format, combine it with other sources of information, visualize the data in various ways, and export the data in a structured format so that it can be used with other tools.</td>

Karma maintains a library of wrappers by automatically linking to the OpenKapow and Fetch wrapper repositories present on the local machine. The user can directly execute a wrapper from Karma&rsquo;s interface by providing values for the input parameters (Figure 1).</td>

These patterns are then matched against new input data to identify its semantic type. Semantic types are automatically generated for the data when it is loaded in Karma&rsquo;s table and or the user can also define a new semantic type by simply typing in into the table as per his understanding.</td>

For e.g. in order to remove preceding &ldquo;City of&rdquo; substring from all rows of &ldquo;City&rdquo; column as shown in Figure 3, user needs to provide examples such as &ldquo;Agoura Hills&rdquo; for &ldquo;City of Agoura Hills&rdquo;. Karma will then try to compute the transformation rules and apply it to other values to fill the &ldquo;user-defined&rdquo; column.</td>

The user selects some example data elements from the data for which he wants to specify visualization formatting, and drops it over the interactive pane (in blue color) corresponding to the desired type of visualization. Karma then automatically learns the visualization format with the help of the user-supplied examples, and generalizes it over the remaining data to generate a preview of visualized data in output preview window. It also generates the required program code in background for visualizing the data in specified format in the final mashup output display. Once the user is finished with specifications of data visualization, he can generate the final Mashup by publishing its HTML code. </td>
