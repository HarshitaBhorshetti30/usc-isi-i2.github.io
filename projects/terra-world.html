With the huge amount of geospatial data now available and the enormous amount of data available on the Web, there is a terrific opportunity to exploit the integration of online sources with geospatial sources for knowledge discovery. The challenge is that the dynamic integration of online data and geospatial data is beyond the state of the art of existing integration systems. </td>

Second, given the ability to integrate these diverse types of sources, general integration and visualization frameworks are needed to rapidly assemble these sources to support knowledge discovery. For example, one might want a mediator that can support ad hoc queries that require dynamically integrating geospatial and online data sources. Or one might want a more specialized integration framework that supports the integration of specific types of sources to support a given knowledge discovery task. </td>

The applications that integrate information from various geospatial data sources must be able to overcome these inconsistencies accurately, in real-time and for large regions. Traditionally, this problem has been in the domain of the image processing and GIS systems. However, the conflation approach (Saalfeld 1993) used in various GIS systems to manually or semi-automatically align two geo-spatial data sets does not scale up to large regions. Image processing techniques to identify objects in the image in order to resolve vector-image inconsistencies require significant CPU time and may result in inaccurate results. 	</td>

Traditionally, human input has been essential to find control point pairs and/or filter control points.  Instead, we developed completely automatic techniques to find control point pairs in both datasets and designed novel filtering techniques to remove inaccurate control points.</td>

We briefly describe the first technique, which relies only on the imagery and vector data for accurate integration. We find feature points, such as the road intersection points, from the vector dataset.  For each intersection point, we perform image processing in a small area around the intersection point to find the corresponding point in the satellite image.  The running time for this approach is dramatically lower than traditional image processing techniques due to localized image processing.  Furthermore, the road directions information makes detecting edges in the image much easier problem, thus reducing the running time even more. </td>

However, accurately integrating maps and imagery from different data sources remains a challenging task.  This is because spatial data obtained from various data sources may have different projections and different accuracy levels. If the geographic projections of these datasets are known, then they can be converted to the same geographic projections.  However, the geographic projection for a wide variety of geo-spatial data available on the Internet is not known.  The fact that many of the online maps sources do not provide the geo-coordinates of the maps makes the integration even more complicated. </td>

Experimental results on the city of El Segundo demonstrate that our approach lead to remarkably accurate alignments of maps and satellite imagery.

A spatio-temporal range query imposes bounds on spatial and temporal attributes and asks for all tuples satisfying the constraints.

Traditional data sources such as satellite imagery, maps, gazetteers and vector data have long been used in <i>geographic information systems</i> (GIS).  However, incorporating non-traditional sources such as phone books and property tax sites brings to light integration issues that have not previously been dealt with.  For example, it is not clear how phone book information (i.e. street name and building number) could be combined with road vector data to label buildings found in a satellite image.</td>

For example, we can imagine a scenario where different data sources are used to populate a geospatial database for a given area.  Data can be retrieved and integrated from multiple sources, both traditional and non-traditional.  The resulting integrated data can be stored in a standard format, such as the Gazetteer Content Standard proposed by the Alexandria Digital Library (ADL) or  the Web Gazetteer service (WFS-G) Standard proposed by OpenGIS and made available to the public.  If this process could be automated, the creation and maintenance of public gazetteers would become much easier.</td>

	      <td colspan="2" class="main_page_text" align="justify">Our approach uses a <i>constraint satisfaction problem</i> (CSP) approach for assigning labels (street name and address) to buildings in a given satellite image.  The general framework of the system can be seen in Figure 8.  It is comprised of three main components; a set of publicly available information sources, the CSP model, and the CSP solver.  The intuition behind this framework is as follows: begin by gathering all of the publicly available data, such as satellite imagery, vector data, and a phone book.  Then incorporate this data into a CSP model that is created using the CSP formulation explained below.  After creating a new problem instance, the CSP model is passed to the CSP solver.  The CSP solver returns all of the possible solutions to the problem.  Finally merge the solutions to create a set of possible street and address assignments for each building and return this set as the final solution.</td>

	      <td colspan="2" class="main_page_text" align="justify">The approach we present is a novel way to use both explicit and implicit information in publicly available data sources.  The key challenge lies in combining this information and using it to label buildings in satellite imagery with a high degree of accuracy.  Using a constraint satisfaction framework allows us to address the integration issue by generating a CSP model that allows all of the information to be plugged in easily.  Finally, leveraging common properties of streets and addresses in the world allows us to provide solutions that could not be deduced from any individual source but require the combination of data from multiple sources.
