Operators can be thought of as finite state machines that, when enabled, perform a specific type of information management action. Operator inputs in Theseus are similar to planning pre/post-conditions, except that they can also carry data, thus allowing information to be easily routed through the plan. Declaring plans with operators that produce and consumed named data allows execution to be specified succinctly, only in terms of those control and data dependencies necessary to ensure correct execution.</td>

This prediction is used as the input into the next operator (select), while the first wrapper is still retrieving the result. Before the plan returns the data, the speculation result is verified with the result from the first wrapper and only correct results are allowed as the output of the plan.</td>
